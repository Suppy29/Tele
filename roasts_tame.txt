You're so slow, Internet Explorer calls you outdated.
I'd explain it to you, but I don't have any crayons with me right now.
You're not stupid, you just have bad luck thinking.
I bet your browser history is just "how to use Google" searches.
You're like a software update - nobody wants you, but you keep showing up anyway.
I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.
You're proof that even evolution can go in reverse.
You have the perfect face for radio and the perfect voice for silent movies.
If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person alive.
You're like a participation trophy - everyone gets one, but nobody really wants it.
I'm not saying you're dumb, but you make me miss my dial-up internet connection.
You're the human equivalent of a screensaver - pretty to look at, but completely useless.
