You're about as useful as a chocolate teapot in hell.
I've seen more intelligence in a bag of hammers having an existential crisis.
You couldn't pour water out of a boot if the instructions were written on the heel.
Your family tree must be a cactus because everybody on it is a prick.
You're like a broken pencil - completely pointless and nobody wants to deal with you.
I'd call you a tool, but that would imply you're actually useful for something.
You have the personality of wet cardboard and half the charm.
If stupidity was a superpower, you'd be wearing a cape right now.
You're the reason aliens won't visit Earth anymore.
I bet when you were born, the doctor slapped your parents instead.
You're like a cloud - when you disappear, it's a beautiful day.
The only way you could be a bigger disappointment is if you tried harder.
